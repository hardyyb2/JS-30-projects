    //doesnt cahnge the orginal
    const team2= [].concat(players)
    console.log(players,team2)
    team2[2]="yo"
    console.log(players,team2)
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
//no change
    const team3 =[...players]
    console.log(players,team3)

    const team4= players.slice()
    //or
    const team5= Array.from(players)
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

const person2 =person
console.log(person,person2)
    // how do we take a copy instead?
const person3 = Object.assign({},person);

const person4 = Object.assign({},person,{number:6,hope:10});
console.log(person,person4)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
